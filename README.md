# Front End Developer: Take Home Assessment

Create a weather app complete with a login system.  The app needs a search prompt that reaches out to a weather api of your choice and has the ability to favorite the cities by zip code or name. Once the city has been added, create a checker that keeps monitoring the city for temperature or condition changes.  There needs to be an alert and notification based on criteria.  For example: notify if Miami is hotter than 82 degrees.  The alerts must be set to multiple cities.  These checks should not be hardcoded.

Bonus question: Make this an offline app in case the browser is not connected to the internet.
